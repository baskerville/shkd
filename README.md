## Description

shkd is a simple hotkey daemon for the Linux console.

## Usage

### SYNOPSIS
    shkd [OPTIONS] INPUT_DEVICE ...

### OPTIONS
* `-h`: Show the synopsis and quit.
* `-v`: Show the version and quit.
* `-t`: Output the name and the keycode of the incoming key press events (press *esc* to quit).
* `-c CONFIG_FILE`: Read configuration from the given file instead of the default (`/etc/shkdrc`).

## Configuration File Format

Each line of the configuration file is interpreted as so:

- If it starts with `#`, it is ignored.
- If it starts with one or more white space characters (cf. `man 3 isspace`) it is read as a command.
- Otherwise, it is parsed as a hotkey: each key name is separated by spaces or `+` characters.

Example:

    brightnessup
        foo +1

    volumedown
        bar -1

    meta + alt + shift + ctrl + release + zenkakuhankaku
        baz --quux /foo/bar

## Installation

    make
    make install
